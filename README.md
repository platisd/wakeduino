A bio-alarm clock based on arduino and an IR sensor to detect movements. After pointing the IR sensor towards the body of the user, it wakes him up
on the specified time +- a threshold window, when it detects a specific amount of movements, which would indicate that he is in the end of a sleep cycle, causing
the user to wake up more fresh.

* Not fully developed as of yet since I have been pulled into a research project. It's almost ready though. Some bugs to be fixed with the various state changes
when the clock is supposed to ring mostly. And of course needs to be tested experimentally.
