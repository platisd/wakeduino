A bio-alarm clock based on arduino and an IR sensor to detect movements. After pointing the IR sensor towards the body of the user, it wakes him up on the specified time +- a threshold window, when it detects a specific amount of movements, which would indicate that he is in the end of a sleep cycle, causing the user to wake up more fresh.
